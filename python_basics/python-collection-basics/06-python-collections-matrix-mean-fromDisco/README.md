# Task - Matrix mean

You are given a two dimensional list of numbers. Calculate the mean of those numbers by implementing a `mean` method that takes a list as an argument.

## Input:

```
numbers = [[5, 6, 3], [8, 3, 1], [9, 10, 4], [8, 4, 2]]
 
 5  6  3  | 4.67 
 8  3  1  | 4
 9 10  4  | 7.67
 8  4  2  | 4.67
 â€“  â€“  â€“
 |  |  |
 |  | 2.5
 | 5.75
7,5   

verical: 15,75 -> 5,25
horizontal: 5,2525 

```

## Output:

```
> mean(numbers)

[19, 65, 23, 90]

```
